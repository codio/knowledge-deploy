Preinstalled Software Packages
==============================

When you create an empty box in Codio, you get a standard Ubuntu server and Git software.

If you want additional software installed by default, use :ref:`Stacks <stacks>` or select one of the standard stacks from the **New Project** screen.

Refer to the :ref:`Install software packages <box_parts>` for details about how to install other languages, databases, web servers, and other system components.
