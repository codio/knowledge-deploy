Codio provides a way to install the set of software packages that are in high demand. You can install this software from the **Tools > Install Software** menu. From the **Install software** page, you can run scripts that install, configure, or reconfigure software components instead of manually installing them from the command line.

Locate the software that you want to install and click the **Install** icon to start the installation.

Install software from the command line
--------------------------------------
Our boxes provide full `sudo` (root) access, so you can also use the Ubuntu `apt <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGet/Howto>`_ package manager, which provides thousands of software packages that are maintained by the Ubuntu community.

If you want to provide fully pre-configured boxes, use :ref:`Stacks <stacks>` instead the **Install Software** option.


Add or request new software packages
------------------------------------
You can request new software packages or add a new package yourself. If you require a new script to be added to the **Install Software** list, use one of the following methods:

- Visit the `Issues <https://github.com/codio/install_software/issues>`_ page on our GitHub repository and create a new issue detailing your requirements.

- Fork our `GitHub repository <https://github.com/codio/install_software>`_, add the script yourself, and then submit a pull request.

For instructions on how to add your own software package scripts, see :ref:`Add Your Own Packages <parts-coding>`.

Autostart
---------
Services that require a restart, are automatically started on installation. You can manually start, stop, and restart services using the following terminal commands:

``$ sudo service <package-name> start``

``$ sudo service <package-name> stop``

``$ sudo service <package-name> restart``

Restricting Students from installing unauthorized software
----------------------------------------------------------

If you wish to restrict students' ability to install software packages in course assignments, you can do so at the course level. See :ref:`revoking sudo access for all course assignments <course-revoke-sudo>` for more information.
