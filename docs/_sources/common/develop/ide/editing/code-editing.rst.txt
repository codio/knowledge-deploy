Codio has various IDE features to enhance productivity when working with HTML, CSS, and Javascript files. These features are based on the `Emmet <http://www.emmet.io>`__ web-developers toolkit (formerly Zen Coding). For additional information about Emmet syntax, see the `Emmet documentation <http://docs.emmet.io/abbreviations/syntax/>`__.
