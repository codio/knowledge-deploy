Preview
=======
The Preview feature enables you to view your static and dynamic content. The menu options are configurable for both types of content:

* **Preview status options** - Can be used for only static content (HTML, CSS, JS, and text). You can also easily preview static content on your mobile device using **Project > QR Code for Preview URL** to generate a QR code that you can scan with a QR reader on your device.

* **Preview dynamic options** - To access files or services that are executed on the server (PHY, Ruby, Note, etc.), you need to use the right-most menu option. 
  
  To access your server side application, enter **word1-word2-port.codio.io**. This accesses your box over port 80, which is useful if your corporate firewall blocks ports other than 80 and 443.
  
  **word1-word2** is an automatically generated subdomain name for your Codio box. You can configure your application to listen on ports defined in the URL. However, Codio only supports a restricted range of ports. Refer to this section for more details (insert link).

Using preview
-------------
Using the **Preview** button lets you preview one or more web pages with a simple button press. Codio creates three default entries in the Preview menu automatically:

* Project Index - this is the default file to run for your project. It can be set by right-clicking a file in the Filetree. This option should be used to preview static content (typically HTML files). For PHP, Ruby, etc., you should use the Box URL option.
* Current File - whichever code file currently has focus. This option should only be used to preview static content (typically HTML files). For PHP, Ruby, etc., you should use the Box URL option.
* Box URL - Use this option for previewing PHP, Ruby, or other server side languages over HTTPS. Click here <insert link> for more information on configuring port access for HTTPS.

If you right-click a file in the file tree or the tab, you can also select **Preview Static**.

Modifying the Preview menu
--------------------------
You can customize the **Preview** menu using one of the following methods:

- From the **Preview** or **Run** drop-down menus, choose **Configure**.
- Open the **.codio** file in the root (`/home/codio/workspace` or `~/workspace`)of your project (if it exists).

To customize the Run and Preview buttons, modify this section of the **.codio** file:

.. code:: ini

    {
    // Configure your Run and Preview buttons here.

    // Run button configuration
      "commands": {
            "Node version": "node --version"
      },

    // Preview button configuration
      "preview": {
            "Project Index (static)": "https://{{domain}}/{{index}}",
            "Current File (static)": "https://{{domain}}/{{filepath}}",
            "Box URL": "https://{{domain3000}}/"
      }
    }


You can insert tokens to customize the menus:

``{{domain3000}}`` is replaced by the public url required to access your project over port 80, which is useful if your corporate firewall blocks ports other than 80 and 443.

``{{domain80}}`` can also be used instead of {{domain3000}} and is replaced by the public url required to access your project over port 80.

``{{domain}}`` is used along with the port number (default 3000) to your service. For example:

``"Box URL": "https://{{domain3000}}/",``

For details about the various tokens that can be inserted see :ref:`Customize Run Button <customizable-run-menu>`.

.. Note:: Static content is served over Port 80. To access dynamic content you may need to specify the appropriate Port.


Unsecure content error
----------------------
Codio runs over a secure connection using HTTPS, therefore so does the inline preview. If your code references an external resource such as a script, font, or image, a browser error may occur indicating that there is some form of unsecure or mixed content because you are running in a mixed HTTP/HTTPS mode. This may occur when you reference something similar to the following:

.. code:: html

    <script src="http://code.angularjs.org/1.1.5/angular.js">


The error is caused by a restriction of the browser and cannot be easily modified. It is intended to protect you from insecure content.

To avoid this from occurring:

- Modify your external references to use HTTPS.
- Modify your references to use the 'current protocol' by including '//' without http or https, so `<script src="//code.angularjs.org/1.1.5/angular.js">`.

You can also download the external file to the Codio project and then reference it.
