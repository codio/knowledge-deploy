Autostart Services
==================
Your box is automatically configured to autostart, which means it is automatically put to sleep, and when you open your project, the box and services are started. 

You can also configure other services to autostart in the **startup.sh** bash script in your project or by installing **Autostart Support** from **Tools > Install Software**.

For the script to be included in the stack we recommend `/home/codio/startup.sh`.

If the project is using guides, you can use `.guides/startup.sh` or you can put the file in the workspace; students may be able to access and edit files visible to them in the workspace. 

Upstart
-------
Upstart can be used in Ubuntu 14.04 boxes. If you want to configure services to start when your box starts up, you should configure a **.conf** file. If you are not familiar with upstart, please Google it for configuration details.

Systemd
-------
Systemd can be used in Ubuntu 18.04 and 22.04 boxes. If you want to configure services to start when your box starts up, you should configure a **.service** file and run ``sudo systemctl daemon-reload``. If you are not familiar with systemd, please Google it for configuration details.

**Important** - You must specify the user account under which the service is run using ``setuid codio``.

When is the Server put back to sleep?
-------------------------------------
Your server is put to sleep within a few minutes of you exiting your Project or after 60 minutes of inactivity.
