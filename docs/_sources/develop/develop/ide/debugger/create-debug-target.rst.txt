Create and Manage Debugger Targets
==================================

Before you can start debugging a project, you must first create your debug targets. Creating multiple targets allows you to:

-  Quickly debug the same application with different command line arguments to test different scenarios.
-  Debug more than one application.

You manage your debug targets on the **Debugger Settings** page.

Create a debug target
---------------------

To create a debug target, follow these steps:

1. Click the **Tools** tab on the menu bar and choose **Debugger Settings**. Alternatively, you can click the **Configure** tab on the far right on the menu bar.

2. On the Debugger Settings page, click **Create**.

3. Click the **Debugger Type** drop-down and choose the programming language.

   If you are using C, C++, or Java, and debugging a simple single code file project, choose **Single C File**, , or **Single Java file** so you don't need to provide detailed compile and run configurations.

   The field that are displayed depend on the programming language that is selected.

4. Enter a **Name** for the configuration and then complete the fields on the form. Typically, you need to provide:

   -  The command to execute to your program along with any command line parameters you may want to include.
   -  Command to execute before debugging starts. This is usually a compile process.

   You can also reference the active file in use using ``{{filepath}}`` token which inserts the path and full file name (/path/to/file.ext).

   -  If you are not using a single file configuration, you must also complete the following fields:

     -  **Before Launch** - Compilation or build command.
     -  **Launch** - Command to launch the program.

   -  If you are creating a target for a Java application, you must also set the **Debugger Port Number** to **5105**.

5. Click **Create Target**.

You are now ready to :ref:`start-debug`.
