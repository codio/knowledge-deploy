Autocomplete
============
Autocomplete is supported in HTML, CSS, and Javascript files. Simply start typing and matches are automatically displayed.

If you choose, you can disable autocomplete in your preferences:

``automatic_completions = false``

Other languages are supported with **language server protocol** although in such files, autocomplete is not automatically enabled. See :ref:`Language Server Protocol <langserver>` for more information.

HTML tags
---------
Autocomplete is context sensitive, so you will only be shown tags that are relevant to your location in the HTML file.

For example, if you are not in ``<body></body>``, fewer autocomplete options are shown. If you place your cursor inside the ``<body></body>`` tags, a full list of standard HTML tags are shown.

HTML attributes
---------------
If you enter ``<a`` and invoke autocomplete, a list of relevant attributes for the ``<a>`` tag are shown.

Tern and javascript
-------------------
We support intelligent autocomplete using TernJS. Tern also supports explicit directives in the **.tern-project** file, which you can move to the root (`/home/codio/workspace` or `~/workspace`) of your project.

The file looks like this:

.. code:: json

    {
      "libs": [
        "browser",
        "jquery"
      ],
      "loadEagerly": [
        "importantfile.js"
      ],
      "plugins": {
        "requirejs": {
          "baseURL": "./",
          "paths": {}
        }
      }
    }


Codio only supports autocomplete for the currently opened file and items specified in the ``libs`` section of the **.tern-project** file. Refer to the `Tern documentation <https://ternjs.net/doc/manual.html#configuration>`_ for full details on how to configure the **.tern-project** file.

CSS
---
To invoke autocomplete in a css file, use the **ctrl+space** keyboard shortcut.
