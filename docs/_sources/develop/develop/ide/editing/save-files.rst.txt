Save Files
==========

There is generally no need to save your files as content is saved automatically. You can still save manually using the `Ctrl+S|Cmd+S` keyboard shortcut, but it isn't necessary.
If you make a mistake, you can use undo (`Ctrl+Z`).

Version Control is the best possible way of managing restores and this is comprehensively supported using our :ref:`Git integration <git>`.
