Open a File
===========

To open a file, simply navigate to the file and select it in the left Filetree. When you open a file, it appears in a tab in the currently active :ref:`Panel <panels>`.

Codio applies syntax highlighting based on the file type, which is displayed in the lower status bar. If you want to change the syntax highlighting to another language format, click the file type in the lower right corner and choose another language from the list.
