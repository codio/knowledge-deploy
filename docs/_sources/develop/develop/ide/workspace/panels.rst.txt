Panels, Tabs, and Layouts
=========================

The Codio IDE gives you complete control over your project layout using panels, tabs, and layouts. 

Panels
------
You can arrange your panels using the **View > Panels** menu options or shortcuts. Whenever you exit the project, its precise panel configuration is saved and reloaded when you open it again.

If you have multiple panels in your layout, click in a panel to bring it into focus (white border around it).

If you want to open a file in a different panel, click in the panel where you want to open it, and then select the file in the Filetree.

To close a panel, click in the panel and then click **View > Panels > Close**. You can also use the shortcut keys **Cmd+Alt+C** (Mac) and **Ctrl+Alt+C** (PC/Linux).


Tabs
----
Whenever you open a file, it opens in a new tab. You can have multiple tabs open in any panel. You can also drag tabs within a panel and to other panels.

The Filetree is a tab within a panel. You can move it to another panel, close it, and re-open it. To reopen it, click **View > Filetree** menu bar.

You can cycle between tabs in a panel using the keyboard shortcuts:

- **Alt+Shift+.** - takes you to the previous tab.
- **Alt+Shift+.** - takes you to the next tab. 

You can also customize these shortcuts in :ref:`User Preferences <user-prefs>`:

- ``tab_switch_left``
- ``tab_switch_right``

To expand a tab to full screen mode, press **F11** on your keyboard. To reduce the size, press **F11** again.

.. Note:: Some Mac users may find that **F11** is blocked. You can easily modify the keyboard shortcut in :ref:`User Preferences <user-prefs>`.


Layouts
-------
You can choose the layout of your workspace from the **View > Layouts** menu:

- **Default** - The default layout includes two panels layed out horizontally. To reset your layout to the default, click **View > Layouts > Default**. You can also use the shortcut keys **Cmd+Alt+R** (Mac) and **Ctrl+Alt+R** (PC/Linux).

- **Split Vertical** - Splits the selected panel by drawing a vertical line down the middle, so you end up with two panels side-by-side. You can also use the shortcut keys **Cmd+Alt+V** (Mac) and **Ctrl+Alt+V** (PC/Linux).

- **Split Horizontal** - Splits the selected panel by drawing a horizontal line across the middle, so you end up with one panel on top of the new panel. You can also use the shortcut keys **Cmd+Alt+H** (Mac) and **Ctrl+Alt+H** (PC/Linux).
