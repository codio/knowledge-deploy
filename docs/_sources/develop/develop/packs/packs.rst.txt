Starter Packs offer an easy way to get started using templates of projects that include:

- A base Ubuntu operating system. 
- A :ref:`Stack <stacks>` which includes base software dependencies such as databases, languages and other system components (optional).
- Any code present in your project. 

Using Starter Packs, you can organize and share your own packs, or use Codio's certified packs. If you want additional Starter Packs, you can easily create your own or you can submit a request for Codio to add one for you. Simply email us at help@codio.com with full details and we'll try to get it added for you.

Follow these steps to view and use a Starter Pack:

1. In the navigation pane, click **Starter Packs**.
