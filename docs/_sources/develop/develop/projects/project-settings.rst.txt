Project Settings
================
The Settings page within a project includes various options for specifying settings related to the project, including:

- Project Name and Description
- Public or Private Project
- Allow Box Cloning (payment required)
- Allow Private Static Preview. See :ref:`Preview <preview>` for more information. This setting is only available from **Project > Settings**.
- Protect Dynamic Ports. Enable to restrict preview to the owner of the box; disable to allow preview of the box to anyone who knows the box url. This setting is only available from **Project > Settings**.
- Stack Settings - specify current stack and version used in your project.
- Forwarding Settings - This function is now deprecated. To synchronise local code workspace files with a Codio box see :ref:`Desktop App <desktop-app>`.
- Gigaboxes Settings - set this to a larger size if you have a memory intensive project. You must first request a larger box for your organization. Contact help@codio.com to initiate this discussion. If you add your project to a course as an assignment, as you publish your assignment, the **Propagate gigabox settings to the assignment settings** option on the publish assignment dialog will show. By default it is enabled but you can disable it if you choose.
