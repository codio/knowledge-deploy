Project Preferences
===================
Project preferences get the highest priority and are applied over :ref:`User Preferences <user-prefs>`. You access the **Project Preferences** from your project using one of the following methods:

- Click **Codio > Preferences > Project** on the menu bar.
- In the Filetree, open the **.settings** file.

You can modify any of the settings but use caution since project preferences will override user preferences.
