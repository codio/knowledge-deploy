Enable SSO Integration
======================

You can enable sso integration to integrate with your own SSO service provider from the **Organization > Integrations** page in Codio.

    .. image:: /img/sso-integration.png
       :alt: SSO Integration
       
.. Important:: Your SSO Custom User fields need to be set up with **FirstName**, **LastName**, **Email Address** and **Role** (Teacher/Mentor or Student).

Enable SSO
----------

1: Enable SSO and select the SSO type. Currently suported **SAML 2.0**

2: Log in to your SSO service provider

3: Find and add the SAML application 

4: Go to **Configuration** and copy in from Codio

    - the **Login URL**
    - the **ACS (CONSUMER) URL**
    - the **ACS (CONSUMER) URL VALIDATOR**
    
5: Save the configuration

6: Go to **Parameters** and set up the Custom User fields, checking **Include in SAML assertion** mapping the value field to the relevant fields from your SSO

    - for **Role**, set the value to **Role(Custom)**
    
7: Go to **SSO** and copy the **SAML 2.0 Endpoint HTTP** and paste into the **Identity Provider URL** field in Codio, and find and copy the **X. 509 Certificate** into the **Certificate** field in Codio.

.. Note:: These field names relate to OneLogin and may be different in other service providers

8: In Codio set up the Attributes to map the Custom User fields from your SSO service provider (see below)

9: Press the **Update** button in Codio to create the integration

10: Configure your SSO users to use the SAML application

11: Copy and distribute the **Login URL** from the Codio integration field for your users to use


Setting up Attributes
---------------------

The attribute field in Codio is how your SSO custom user fields are mapped to Codio.

example:

.. code:: json

    {
        "mapAttributes": {
            "email": "Email",
            "firstName": "FirstName",
            "lastName": "LastName",
            "role": "Role"
        },
        "mapRoles": {
            "student": ["student"],
            "teacher": ["teacher"]
        }
    }

Where in your SSO you have set up the custom user fields as **Email**, **FirstName**, **LastName**, **Role** and your roles as **student**, **teacher**

If your SSO service provider provides urn:oid attributes for the custom user fields, you can use those

example:

.. code:: json

    {
        "mapAttributes": {
            "email": "urn:oid:0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.3",
            "firstName": "urn:oid:2.5.4.42",
            "lastName": "urn:oid:2.5.4.4",
             "role": "Role"
        },
        "mapRoles": {
            "student": ["student"],
            "teacher": ["teacher"]
        }
    }

SSO Roles
---------

The SSO roles you set will determine whether the user accesses Codio as either a student or teacher. If your SSO service provider supports Mentor role, that can also be set for teachers who you wish to access with :ref:`Read Only <add-teachers_org>` access.

Login URL
---------
       
When set up, the login URL can then be used by your users to login through your SSO service provider.  

.. Note:: Your users will still be able to access Codio from the usual login URL but will not be authenticated through your SSO service provider.

Changing Email address in SSO
-----------------------------

If the users email address is changed in the SSO, by default a new Codio account will be created when users access Codio from the SSO. To avoid this, instruct your users to log into Codio directly first and change their :ref:`account email address <user-profile>` before accessing from the SSO.
