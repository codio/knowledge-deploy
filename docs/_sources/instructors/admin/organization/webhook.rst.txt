Webhooks
========
Webbhooks allow receiving Codio events by calling your endpoint. 

The system wonâ€™t retry webhook calls for any missed events you can query the API event object using loadEvents function.

You can add your own Webhooks to your Codio organization from the **Organization > Integrations** page in Codio.

Go to the **Webhooks** area and **Add Webhook**

To add a webhook enter the URL of your server and press create, the system will send a test request to check endpoint validity.

All requests contain a JWT signature you can verify using codio keys https://apollo.codio.com/lti/oidc/certs (or https://apollo.codio.co.uk/lti/oidc/certs if working on codio.co.uk)


Example app to receive webhooks into a Codio project can be found here: https://github.com/iyashtykov/webhook-server
