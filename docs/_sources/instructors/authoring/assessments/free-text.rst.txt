Free Text
=========
Free text assessments allow students to answer questions in their own words. Because Free Text assessments allow for LaTeX formatting, this type of assessment is recommended for math assessments. Teachers are then able to review and manually grade their answers.

      :alt: Assessment Generation Prompt

If you are not satisfied with the result, select **Regenerate** to create a new version of the assessment. You can provide additional guidance in the **Generation Prompt** field. For example, *create assessment based on the first paragraph with 2 correct answers.*

4. When you are satisfied with the result, press **Apply** and then **Create**.

More information about generating assessments may be found on the :ref:`AI assessment generation <ai-assessment-generation>` page.

    - **Plaintext** - Students enter ordinary text with no markdown formatting; there is no preview window.
    - **Plaintext + LaTeX** - Students enter plaintext with no markdown formatting but offers support for LaTeX commands. A preview window is available where students can see the rendered LaTeX output.

You can set when to show this selecting from **Never**, **After x attempts**, **If score is greater than or equal to a % of the total** or **Always**

  - **Rationale** - Enter guidance for the assessment. This is visible to the teacher when the project is opened in the course or when opening the student's project. This guidance information can also be shown to students after they have submitted their answer and when they reload the assignment after marking it as completed.

For example, if an assessment asks the student to predict the output of a recursive code segment, then its Learning Objectives could be *SWBAT follow the flow of recursive execution*.
  - **Tags** - By default, **Content** and **Programming Language** tags are provided and required. To add another tag, click **Add Tag** and enter the name and values.

5. Click **Files** in the left navigation pane and check the check boxes for additional external files to be included with the assessment. The files are then included in the **Additional content** list.
