Math Assessments
================


Codio allows you to set and grade math questions for any type and level of mathematics using the **Free Text** assessment. We only offer manual grading of mathematical expressions or proofs.


Manually graded assessments using free text
*******************************************

To create a manually graded math question, you can use the **Free text** assessment type. This allows the students to enter expressions or even full proofs and worked answers using Latex. For more information about Latex, please :ref:`click here <latex>`. 

You can enter Latex in the **Question** and **Rationale** fields.

You should also set the **Preview type** drop down to either **Plaintext + Latex** or **Markdown + Latex**. Both of these ensure that the student sees a preview pane beneath their answer entry fully rendered in markdown and/or Latex. Please - :ref:`click here <free-text>` to review the free text assessment.

Multiple choice
***************

You can also use the multiple choice assessment type to create answers containing properly rendered Latex expressions.
