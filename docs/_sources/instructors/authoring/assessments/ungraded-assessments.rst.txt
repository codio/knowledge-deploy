Ungraded Assessments
====================
As an instructor, you can set up assessments that are not graded. They can be used as a consequence free way to check a student's understanding of the content. The assessment is not graded if the correct/incorrect points are set to zero (0). No points are added or deducted from the student's overall grade for the assignment.
