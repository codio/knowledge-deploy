Freezing Code
=============

If you wish to freeze portions of code in a code file that students won't be able to edit, you can surround the code with the tags **FREEZE CODE BEGIN** and **FREEZE CODE END**. Use the appropriate syntax for your programming language (ex. Python - '#', C++ - '//' to designate these lines as comments. The section of code will be highlighted to the students along with a padlock icon at the top right of the code block. Check that you do not have mis-matched BEGIN and END statements by viewing the assignment as a test student.

Example Python solution file:

.. code:: python

    def main:
        # FREEZE CODE BEGIN
        print('Hello world!')
        # FREEZE CODE END

will then show to students as:

     :alt: Frozen Code

If you just wish to highlight code to the students but allow them to be able to edit, you can use **Highlight** in :ref:`Open Tabs <open-tabs>`.
