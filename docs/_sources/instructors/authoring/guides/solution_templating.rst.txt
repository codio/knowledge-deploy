Solution File Templating
========================

To help you test/check solutions for students prior to publishing, you can write your solution code within tags **CODIO SOLUTION BEGIN** and **CODIO SOLUTION END**. Use the appropriate syntax for your programming language (ex. Python - '#', C++ - '//' to designate these lines as comments. The code will be visible to the teacher when editing the assignment and allow the code to be executed for testing purposes but will not be available to the student when the assignment is published. Check that you do not have mis-matched BEGIN and END statements by viewing the assignment as a test student.

Example Python solution file:

.. code:: python

    def main:
        # CODIO SOLUTION BEGIN
        print('Hello world!')
        # CODIO SOLUTION END

will then show to students as:

.. code:: python

    def main:
        # WRITE YOUR CODE HERE 

.. Note:: In order that other teachers working with the assignment in a course can also see the solution information to help their students, it is recommended that the solution information is also included within the guidance code block `|||guidance ..... |||` on the guides page or in a specific :ref:`Teacher Only <teacher-only>` page.
