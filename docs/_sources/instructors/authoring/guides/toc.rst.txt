Accessing the table of contents
*******************************
To open and close the table of contents, press the **Index Icon** at the top right. From here you can add and organize content.


Chapters, sections and pages
****************************
A guide is comprised of pages organized into chapters and sections. A chapter is a top level item only. Sections can be placed at any location and nested to any depth.

You can add a new chapter, section or page by

- right clicking on the appropriate location within the table of contents.
- by first selecting the item in the table of contents below which the new element should be added and then pressing one of the buttons at the top of the table of contents.

Deleting pages, chapters and sections
*************************************
When in edit mode and viewing the table of contents you can select the item or hover over the item you wish to delete and use the trash can icon that appears on the right. Alternatively, you can ctrl-click (Mac) or right-click (PC) on a page or chapter or section and select delete from the menu of options that appears.

Adding content to a chapter or section
**************************************
By default, chapters and sections are passive and do not have page content assigned to them. However, you can add content by right-clicking the item and then selecting **Add content** from the menu.

If you want to reverse the procedure, you right click and select **Remove content**.

Multiple selection
******************
You can multi-select pages as follows

- Select an item then `shift+click` on a different item to select all pages between the two items. This only works for items at the same level.
- Use `ctrl+click` (PC/Linux) or  `cmd+click` (Mac) to multi select individual pages.


Drag and Drop
*************

Drag and drop within the table of contents works with individual or multiple selected pages.

The following are the rules that govern the destination of the items you are dropping.

- If you drop in the top portion of the target item, the selection will be dropped above it at the same level.
- If you drop in middle portion of the target item, the selection will be dropped within it if the target is a section.
- If you drop in the lower portion of the target item, the selection will be dropped below the target at the same level.
