Add Teaching Assistant to a Course
===================================

Teaching assistants can be added to a course by sending them an invite. They can then switch between being a teacher and a student. When they are in teacher mode, they can see all the courses in which they are set as a teacher; when in student mode, they see all the courses in which they are set as a student. 

Follow these steps to add a teaching assistant to a course:

1. From the **Courses** page, select the course to open it.
2. Click the **Teachers** tab.


4. Enter the teaching assistant's email address in the **Invite Teacher** box.

5. If you want to restrict the teaching assistant to only be able to view the course but not edit its content, check the **Add this teacher as read-only** check box. You can change this later by toggling the **Course Editor** setting switch.

Enable teaching assistant to be a student in course
---------------------------------------------------
To enable a teaching assistant to be a student in a course, copy the **Student Invite URL** on the **Students** page, selecting the **Add a student** button and send it to your TA. The TA can paste it into a browser and they will be added to the course as a student.
