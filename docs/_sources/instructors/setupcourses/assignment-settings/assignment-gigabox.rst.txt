Gigabox Slot
============
If you have a memory intensive assignment, you can specify here that it should use a Gigabox slot. Gigabox slots are allocated on an :ref:`organization level <gigabox-usage>`.

As you publish your assignment, the **Propagate gigabox settings to the assignment settings** option on the publish assignment dialog will show and will also show if you publish a new version and the gigabox setting for the working copy is different to that set for the assignment. See :ref:`Modify Assignments <modify-assignments>` for more information.

By default it is enabled but you can disable it if you choose.
