Disable Download
================

As well as being able to :ref:`customise the IDE menu <custom-ide>` for students you can also disable the ability for students to download (**Project > Export as Zip**) their assignments before completed in the assignment settings. Once the assignment is completed they can then download the assignment. 

.. Note:: Be aware that if you also enable Read Only with Resubmit option on :ref:`Visibility on Completed <visibility-completed>` setting they can mark as complete, download the zip file and change the status to incomplete to carry on working. If that option is enabled, we suggest you :ref:`customise the IDE menu <custom-ide>` to hide that option whether the assignment is completed or not.


To enable or disable downloading an assignment, follow these steps:

1. Open the assignment **Settings**.
2. In the **Assignment** settings, click **Disable Download by Student** to prevent students from being able to download. 

   To enable the assignment, uncheck **Disable Download by Student**. 

3. Click **Save Changes**.
