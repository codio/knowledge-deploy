Penalties
=========

You can add penalties to the assignment if students don't complete it within the specified start time and closing time.

To apply Penalties, a **Due Date** for the assignment must be set (see :ref:`Assignment Duration <assignment-duration>`), penalties will be applied beginning on the due date.

Add Penalties
-------------
To add a penalty for a late assignment, follow these steps:

1. Open the assignment **Settings**.
2. In the **Penalties** area, enable **Penalty** toggle and complete the following fields:

   - **Late Submission Deduction** - Define the percentage of the total score for the assignment to be deducted as a penalty
   - **Deduction Interval** - Select the interval (Hour or Day) and penalties will be applied on every interval
   - **Lowest Possible Grade** - Penalty deductions will only be taken until the student's grade meets the Lowest Possible Grade and then the grade will not be lowered any further. For example, if the initial grade of a student is 100%, the deduction is 10% per hour, lowest possible grade is 50% and the student is 8 hours late then their final grade will be 50%
 
3. Click **Save Changes**.
