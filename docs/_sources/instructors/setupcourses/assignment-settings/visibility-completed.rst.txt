Visibility on Completed
=======================
The **Visibility on Completed** setting is used to specify your students ability to access the assignment when completed. 

.. Note:: This setting is not available for book-based assignments. 

To specify student visibility to assignments once completed, follow these steps:

1. Open the assignment **Settings**.
2. In the **Assignment** settings, click the **Visibility on Completed** drop-down and choose one of the following options: 

    - **Read Only with Resubmit** - Allows students to access the assignment in *read-only* mode. They can also change the status of their assignment from *completed* to *not completed* and regain full access to resubmit their work. Any assignments not limited to *one attempt only* can be resubmitted.
    - **Read-Only** - Allows students to access their assignment but cannot make changes.
    - **No Access** - Prevents students from accessing their assigment.
    - **No Access until Grades Released** Prevents students from accessing their assignment until the grades are released.
3. Click **Save Changes**.
