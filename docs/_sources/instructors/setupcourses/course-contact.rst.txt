Course contact URL
==================

Contact URLs can be set at the course level to direct students to specific areas or forums for your course where they can raise questions. The contact URLs will override the setting in :ref:`Organization Contact URL <org-contact-url>`. You can set multiple options and specify a default option for students.

When students access the Support Chat they will be shown the options you have specified along with an option to contact Codio directly if they have a problem accessing the Codio platform.

- Select the course, go to the **Course Details** area and **Add Support URLS** where you can then enter the text and URL's to direct students to when they use any of the Contact us options.

.. Note:: "Teacher" accounts will not be effected by this setting and they will still be able to contact Codio in the usual manner. See :ref:`Support <codio-support>` for more on this
