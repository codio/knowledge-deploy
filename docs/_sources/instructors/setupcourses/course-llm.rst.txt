If students exceed any of the limits set above, they will show in the **Reset LLM Keys** area and the teacher/instructors can reset the keys for them to continue working.  

If a student exceeds more than one limit at same time, they will only show once and reetting will reset them for all exceeded limits.

.. Note:: Students WILL need to restart their box after limits are reset (**Project>Restart Box**). If the top menu has been hidden for students then instructors will need to restart their box for them. Open the student assignment and select **Project>Restart Box** before letting the student know they can continue.
