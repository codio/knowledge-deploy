In Codio's Assessments Library, there are two types of layouts that determine how the question is inserted into your assessment:

- **Simple** - An assessment in the library has a **simple** layout if it was added with the **1 Panel without tree** layout. When adding a simple layout question to your project or book, the assessment is inserted into the current page at your cursor's location.

- **Complex** - An assessment in the library has a **complex** layout if it was added with any layout other than **1 Panel without tree**. When adding a complex layout question to your project or book, the assessment is inserted on a new page directly after the current page. If a question has the complex layout, an icon is displayed on the assessment question.
