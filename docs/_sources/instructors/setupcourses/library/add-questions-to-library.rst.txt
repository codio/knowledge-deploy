Add Questions to an Assessments Library
=======================================
Once an assessment is added to an assessment library, it can be accessed later and added to a project or course. 

**Prerequisite:**
Before you can add questions to an assessment library, an Admin in your organization must create an organization assessments library. See :ref:`Create an Organization Assessments Library <org-library>` for more information.

Follow these steps to add questions to your assessments library:

1. Create the assessment (see :ref:`Add a New Assessment <add-assessment>`) for the assignment and be sure to keep the following in mind:

  - Assessments on pages set to the :ref:`*1 Panel without tree* layout <layout>` are saved with a :ref:`simple layout <add-questions-from-library>`.

  - Use the **Metadata** tab to tag your assessment so it appears when the :ref:`searching the assessments library <search-library>`.

  - Use the **Files** tab to ensure all dependent files, such as grading scripts, images used in the guides pane, etc. are associated with the assessment so it works properly when added from the library.

2. Once the assessment is created, click **Save in Library** in the lower right corner on the assessment page.

   If you receive an error message, ensure that you have write access to your organization's assessment library. See :ref:`Create an Organization Assessments Library <org-library>` for more information.

5. Once a question has been added, follow the steps in :ref:`Update an Existing Assessment from Library <update-library>` to update your assessment with the newly added question.
