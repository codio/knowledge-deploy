An **assessment library** in Codio is a collection of existing assessment items that you can add to or pull from to include in your assignments. You can create your own :ref:`organization assessment library <org-library>` or use the :ref:`Codio Global Assessment Library <global-library>`.

You can also use the assessment libraries with the :ref:`Random Assessment <random>` to randomly assign a group of assessments to students.

You can organize your library by course number, programming language, department, etc. and filter the library based on tags when searching for assessments.
