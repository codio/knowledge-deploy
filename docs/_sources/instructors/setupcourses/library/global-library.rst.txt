Codio Global Assessments Library
================================
The Global Assessments Library is an assessment library to which all Codio users have *read-only* access. The library contains auto-graded assessment questions that cover a wide variety of topics, difficulties, and assessment types. We are currently populating it with assessments in:

- Java
- C / C++
- Python
- JavaScript
- Data Structures (in Java)

All assessments in the global library are auto-graded, contain example solutions and answer explanations for the student, and some include teacher notes to help better convey the intended learning objective of the assessment.

Modify question from Global Assessment Library

You can then add your new version of the assessment to your organization's assessment library.
