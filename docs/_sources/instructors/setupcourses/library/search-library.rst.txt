2. Click the **Library Name** drop-down and choose the assessments library you want to search.

3. To narrow the assessments that are displayed, enter a tag and value pair. For example, you can search by the **Programming Language** (tag) and indicate you want **Python** (value) questions. The search is not case sensitive and Codio presents auto-complete suggestions as you type.

   You can also click any of the tag fields in the results to automatically filter and add a new row (click +) to your search query. You can add as many tag:value pairs as needed to narrow your search.
