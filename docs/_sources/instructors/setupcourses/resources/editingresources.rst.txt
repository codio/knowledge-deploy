Editing Resources
=================

Once you have created a course from the codio resources, although there is an inherent link between our resource and your course (see :ref:`Working with Parent/Child Courses <parent-child-courses>` for more information), you can edit/update the content as you wish. See :ref:`Page Editing <page-editing>` for more on this

If our resource is updated in the future you will still see the option to pull the changes into your course but be aware this can then overwrite the changes you made.
