Flode
======

Flode is a flowcharting application, using Javascript as its engine, that allows you to:

-  create annotated flowcharts
-  execute flowcharts
-  write proper code expressions, including decisions, in chart elements
-  integrate a debugger
-  export charts as images for project write-ups
-  input and output elements so automated tests can auto-grade charts

Creating and editing a new Flode file
*************************************

If you want to create Flode charts in your content, start by creating either a new project or assignment in your course. You can use any stack. 

Once inside a project, to create a new flowchart, simply create a new file with the extension ``.flode``. A new Flode window will appear and you can start creating and editing your chart.

A new file is created from either the File menu or by right-clicking on the project name line in the file tree.

To edit an existing ``.flode`` file, simply click on the file name to open the Flode editor.
