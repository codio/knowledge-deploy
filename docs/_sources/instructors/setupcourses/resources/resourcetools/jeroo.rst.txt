Jeroo
=====

Jeroo is now available in Codio as a :ref:`Stack <stacks>`.

|jeroo|

.. Warning:: :ref:`Pair Programming <group-work>` should not be used for Jeroo assignments. 

With :ref:`Codio guides <guides-intro>` you can provide instructions for an assignment side-by-side with the Jeroo environment.

Start by creating either a new project or assignment in your course, selecting the **Jeroo** stack.

When created, select **File > New** from the Codio menu and create a file with an **.jev** suffix for a map file or **.jsc** for a program file.

You can set up your Guide to :ref:`automatically open <open-tabs>` files you want your students to use. If you don't want the guide to take up screen space, you can set it up to :ref:`collapse on open <global>` or students can simply click on the files in the file tree for them to open in Jeroo.

Jeroo files are **not saved automatically**, you must select **File > Save** to save your work.
