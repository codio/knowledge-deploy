Pencil Code
===========

Pencil Code is now available in Codio installing from **Tools->Install Software**

|pencilcode|

.. Warning:: :ref:`Pair Programming <group-work>` should not be used for Pencil Code assignments. 

With :ref:`Codio guides <guides-intro>` you can provide instructions for an assignment side-by-side with the Pencil Code environment.

Start by creating either a new project or assignment in your course and selecting the **Pencilcode Alpha** stack. 

To create an empty Pencil Code project in Codio, select **File > New** from the Codio menu and create a file with an **.pencilcode** suffix. 

You can set up your Guide to :ref:`automatically open <open-tabs>` files you want your students to use. If you don't want the guide to take up screen space, you can set it up to `collapse on open <global>`__ or students can simply click on the files in the file tree for them to open in Pencil Code.
