Scratch
=======


The desktop version of Scratch is available in Codio. This version of Scratch has all the features of the online version but because it is the standalone version, students wonâ€™t be able to view or comment on Scratch community projects.

.. Warning:: :ref:`Pair Programming <group-work>` should not be used for Scratch assignments. 

With :ref:`Codio guides <guides-intro>` you can provide instructions for an assignment side-by-side with the Scratch development environment.

To create an empty Scratch project in Codio, select **File > New** from the Codio menu and create a file with an .sb3 suffix. You can set up
your Guide to :ref:`automatically open <open-tabs>` the Scratch file you want your students to use. If you don't want the guide to take up screen
space, you can set it up to :ref:`collapse on open <global>`.

To use a project you have already created on the web version of Scratch, open the project in Scratch and select **File > Save to your computer** then in Codio select **File > Upload** and open the Scratch file you downloaded.

Scratch files are saved automatically.

Get started by clicking on **Tutorials** in the Scratch menu area. For more information see `Scratch <https://scratch.mit.edu/about>`__.
