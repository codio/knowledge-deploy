Starter Pack
------------
We have a Turtle Graphics in Python Starter Pack to help you get started. 

You can find this by either searching for "turtle" in the starter pack area or:

-  For Codio.com users, `click here <https://codio.com/home/starter-packs/6ff2e3ab-6e02-45fc-9ed8-26793aa77336>`__
-  For Codio.co.uk users, `click here <https://codio.co.uk/home/starter-packs/6ff2e3ab-6e02-45fc-9ed8-26793aa77336>`__

Manual Set up
-------------
Turtle is pre-installed in the Python library, so manual installation is simple:

1. Start by creating either a new project or assignment in your course and selecting the **Python Trajectory Stack**. 

2. Select **Tools** at the top and click **Install software.** Search for **X server** and select install.

3. Once the software has downloaded, go to **Project > Restart Box** in the menu. 

4. Create two files:

- ``.py``: This is the student code file. 
- ``bg.sh``: This is the bash script. 

4. Within the ``bg.sh`` file, write the following bash script:

.. code:: bash

    #!/bin/bash
    set -e
    set -o pipefail
    . /etc/profile.d/codio-xserver.sh
    $1 -m py_compile $2
    nohup $@ > /dev/null 2>&1&

5. Set up your page panels by selecting the **settings wrench** from inside your Guide Editor. Select 3-panels without tree, and then navigate to **Open Tabs.**

6. Under **Open Tabs,** drag in your ``.py`` file and position it in panel 0. 

7. Press the **Add Tab** button and specify the type as **Preview.** Paste the following in the URL field:  ``https://{{domain3050}}/`` Position this in panel 1. 

8. Select **Save and close settings.**

9. The last thing you need to do is set up a **Try It** button so that once code is written in the code file, it can be executed in the server. In the Guide Editor, write the following: ``{Try it}(bash .guides/bg.sh python3 file.py)``

   .. Note:: You need to import the turtle library with ``import turtle`` as the first line of your code and end your code by calling ``turtle.mainloop()``.

10. Turtle automatically chooses the window position. To configure your own behavior create `turtle.cfg` file in the working directory with content defines window position. 

Example:

.. code:: cfg

   leftright=0
   topbottom=0
   width=1.0
   height=1.0
