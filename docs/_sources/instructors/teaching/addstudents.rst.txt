Inviting students to your course
================================

See :ref:`Add or Remove Students in a Course <add-remove-students>`

.. Note:: When integrating with an external system, you do not need to :ref:`add/invite <add-remove-students>` students or teachers to your course. When users access an assignment from the system mapped to Codio, they will automatically be added to the Codio course. The features to invite students into a Codio course directly are not enabled when your course is connected to an external system such as an LMS.
