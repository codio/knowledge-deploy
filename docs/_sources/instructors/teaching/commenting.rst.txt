Code Commenting
===============

Teachers can also comment on code within students files. 

To do this, open the students project and open the file. Hover over the left hand side of the gutter bar and click the `+` to open the comment window and enter the comments as required. This comment will be visible to the student when they next view the file

Multiple lines of code can be selected and the teacher can also edit/delete or add additional comments (from the 3 dots to the right of the comment window when the comment is saved) if required.

When actioned by the student, the comment will be marked as resolved but will still be available for review in the **Education -> Code Comments** menu item or from the Guides settings area.
