Start an Assignment
===================

Follow these steps to begin working on an assignment:

1. Log in to Codio and click **Courses** in the left navigation pane.

2. Click the course to open the **Assignments** page and click **Ready to go** to begin the assignment.

3. If your instructor has connected your course to an LMS system (Blackboard, Canvas, D2l) you must begin your assignments in those systems.

.. Note:: Your instructor can set prerequisite rules to assignments requiring you to have either completed, started or passed with a minimum grade other assignments before you can start a specific assignment.  If set and you have not met those requirements, you will see a message box explaining what is required and if you need help/clarification you can contact your instructor who can help you.
